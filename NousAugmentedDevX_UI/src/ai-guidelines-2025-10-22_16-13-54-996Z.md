### Enterprise Application Design Guidelines for Figma Make

Develop a comprehensive Learning Management System (LMS) that facilitates modern educational delivery and administration. The system should support scalable operations, engaging learning experiences, and compliance with educational regulations like FERPA. It must prioritize accessibility, multi-language support, and seamless integration with various educational tools.

## 1. Design System Foundation

### Brand Identity
- **Logo Integration**: Incorporate the LMS logo with a minimum height of 24px for web visibility.
- **Brand Colors**: Define primary, secondary, and neutral color palettes with semantic meanings for a consistent visual identity.
- **Brand Voice**: Maintain a professional, trustworthy, and approachable tone in all UI copy.
- **Typography Hierarchy**: Establish clear heading levels (H1-H6) with consistent font weights and sizes for readability.

### Color System
- **Primary Colors**: Define 2-3 main brand colors with accessible contrast ratios.
- **Semantic Colors**: Assign colors like Success (green), Warning (amber), Error (red), and Info (blue) for clear communication.
- **Neutral Palette**: Use grays for backgrounds, borders, and text with a minimum of 9 shades.
- **Contrast Requirements**: Ensure WCAG AA compliance for text readability.

## 2. Typography Guidelines

### Font Selection
- **Primary Font**: Choose an enterprise-grade typeface with recommended system fonts for performance.
- **Font Weights**: Include Regular (400), Medium (500), Semi-bold (600), and Bold (700) for hierarchy.
- **Line Heights**: Maintain 1.2 for headings and 1.4-1.6 for body text.
- **Font Sizes**: Establish an 8-point scale ranging from 12px to 48px for various content types.

### Text Hierarchy
- Define clear sizes for H1, H2, H3, Body, and Caption text to maintain consistency and readability across the platform.

## 3. Layout and Grid System

### Grid Structure
- Define grid systems for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile views with appropriate gutters and margins.
- Set a container max-width of 1200px for optimal readability and content organization.
  
### Spacing System
- Use an 8px base unit for consistent spacing and padding throughout the platform.
- Define internal spacing for components and maintain vertical rhythm between content blocks.

## 4. Component Library Specifications

### Navigation Components
- Design primary and mobile navigation components with clear active states and accessibility features.
- Ensure proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support for enhanced usability.

### Form Components
- Specify input field heights, states, labels, and error messaging guidelines for user-friendly interactions.
- Design primary, secondary, and tertiary buttons with various sizes and states for different actions.
- Implement inline validation and form feedback mechanisms for a seamless user experience.

### Data Display Components
- Design tables, cards, and feedback components with clear styling, hierarchy, and interaction states.
- Ensure responsive design for tables and cards to adapt to different screen sizes effectively.

## 5. Web Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance)

### Color and Contrast
- Test and ensure all color combinations meet accessibility standards.
- Implement visible focus states and avoid relying solely on color for conveying information.

### Keyboard Navigation
- Define logical tab orders and provide skip links for screen readers.
- Enable escape functionality for closing modals and dropdowns with the Escape key.

### Screen Reader Support
- Include descriptive ARIA labels, proper heading structures, alt text for images, and explicit form labels for screen reader compatibility.

### Motor Accessibility
- Ensure touch targets are at least 44px x 44px and provide adequate spacing between interactive elements.
- Implement timeout warnings for sessions with time limits to enhance user experience.

## 6. Responsive Design Principles

### Breakpoints
- Define breakpoints for Mobile, Tablet, Desktop, and Large Desktop views for responsive design.
- Follow a mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement for larger screens.

### Mobile-First Approach
- Prioritize content visibility without scrolling, touch interactions, and content priority for mobile users.

## 7. Interaction and Animation Guidelines

### Micro-interactions
- Define durations, easing, and feedback mechanisms for buttons, forms, and page transitions.
- Ensure smooth transitions and feedback for user interactions.

### Page Transitions
- Implement loading states, content updates, and error handling with clear visual feedback.

## 8. Icon System

### Icon Library
- Create a consistent icon library with standard sizes, styles, and accessibility features.
- Use functional icons for navigation and decorative icons sparingly with proper alt text.

## 9. Content Guidelines

### Writing Principles
- Maintain clarity, consistency, actionable language, and inclusivity in all content.
- Design error messages that are specific, helpful, human, and well-positioned for user understanding.

## 10. Performance Considerations

### Image Optimization
- Optimize images with appropriate formats, sizing, and lazy loading techniques for performance.
- Manage assets with reusable components, consistent naming, and organized styles for efficiency.

## 11. Quality Assurance Checklist

### Pre-Development Review
- Ensure design system adherence, color contrast compliance, interactive element sizes, typography consistency, and responsive behavior definition.

### Accessibility Audit
- Verify keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, color-blind friendly colors, alt text for images, and proper form labels.

### Brand Consistency
- Align logo usage, color palette, typography, voice, and tone with the brand guidelines for consistency.
