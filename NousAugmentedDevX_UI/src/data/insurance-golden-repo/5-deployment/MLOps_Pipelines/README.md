# MLOps Pipelines

- **Train → Validate → Stage → Canary → Prod** with signed artifacts.
- Drift detection (PSI/KS), performance regression gates, fairness re‑check.
- Rollback: keep N‑1 warm; feature flags; traffic splitting 5/25/100%.
- Weekly model review cadence; monthly retrain if stable; ad‑hoc on drift.
