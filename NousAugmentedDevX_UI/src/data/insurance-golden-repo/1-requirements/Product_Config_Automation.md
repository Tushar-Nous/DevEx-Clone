# Product Configuration Automation (Insurance)

**Goal:** Accelerate LOB/product filing changes with **templatized configs**, **versioning**, and **safe rollout**.

- **Templates:** coverages, factors, forms, eligibility; YAML with schema and validation.
- **Versioning:** semantic versions tied to DOI filings; effective/expiration dates.
- **Policy:** PR reviews by Product + Compliance; regression packs auto‑generated.
- **Rollout:** canary by tenant/segment; feature flags; auto‑revert on anomalies.
